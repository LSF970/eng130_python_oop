# Lucky draw

# import random
# Can also use:
# from random import *
# changes syntax for use though
# import math


# print(random) # Just shows where the imported file is
# print(random()) # Gives a completely random number 0 - 1

# Calculate DOB or year of birth

from random import *
import math

number = 23.66
# any numbers - to round figure up -
# number 1.50 above round up = 2, 1.49 down round down = 1

print(math.ceil(number)) # Rounds up to the nearest whole number - so even if number = 23.01 it will output 24
print(math.floor(number)) # Round down to the nearest whole number - so even if number = 23.99 it will output 23
